# PCL-PoseEstimation

## Dependencies
- [PCL](http://pointclouds.org/)
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [Realsense SDK](https://dev.intelrealsense.com/docs/compiling-librealsense-for-linux-ubuntu-guide)

This is a [PCL](http://pointclouds.org/) based object recognition and pose estimation refinement project based on PCL's cluster recognition and 6DOF pose estimation using VFH (viewpoint feature histogram) descriptors [tutorial](http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/vfh_recognition.php#vfh-recognition), and the work done as a project for a computer vision course offered in Ko√ß University [PreviousWork](https://github.com/dkebude/PCL-object-recognition).

This continues the previous work and adds an Intel Realsense2 camera as the point cloud input.
