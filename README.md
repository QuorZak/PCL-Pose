# PCL-PoseEstimation

This is a [PCL](http://pointclouds.org/) based object recognition project based on PCL's cluster recognition and 6DOF pose estimation using VFH (viewpoint feature histogram) descriptors [tutorial](http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/vfh_recognition.php#vfh-recognition), and the work done as a project for a computer vision course offered in Ko√ß University [PreviousWork](https://github.com/dkebude/PCL-object-recognition).

This continues the previous work and adds an Intel Realsense2 camera as the point cloud input.
